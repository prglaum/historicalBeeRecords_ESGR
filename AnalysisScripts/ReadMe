R scripts used in the analysis of Graham et al 2024:
All R scripts are commented with detailed instructions. 
We recommend reviewing NNscript_analysis_plots_github.R before investigating code/analysis presented in the
phylogeneticAutocorrelation.R script. This is because this later script utilizes analysis techniques introduced in the NNscript_analysis_plots_github.R script. 

AnalyticalScript_plots:
R script for all the figures from the main text.

NNscripts_analysis_plots:
R script detailing the neural network analysis used in the main text and supplementary material. 

SupplFigures:
R script with all the necessary code for the (non-neural network) figures in the Supplementary Results. 

geoPlotting:
R script detailing the mapping and GIS work done in Graham et al 2024. Also includes code to recreate Figure S26. 

phyloAutCorr:
R scripts detailing the use of Phylogenetic Eigenvector Mapping and other techniques used in analyzing phylogenetic autocorrelation.
